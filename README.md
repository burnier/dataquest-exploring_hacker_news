# dataquest-exploring_hacker_news

In this project we analyze a partial dataset from the Hacker News website. Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

We are especially interedted in posts of these two types:

Ask HN: posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
Show HN`: posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting
With our analysis we want to answer following quesitons:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
